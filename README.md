# MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment)

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is a bioinformatics technique used to compare and align three or more biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. The goal of MSA is to identify similarities and differences between the sequences, which can provide valuable insights into their evolutionary relationships, structural features, and functional characteristics.

## ggMSA 

"ggMSA" is a visualization technique used for Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA). With this technique, the similarities or differences between sequences can be visualized in a more appealing way. It allows for a better understanding of the alignment results.
If you want to learn more about the ggMSA package you can visit the following GitHub account (https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/ggmsa).

### You don't need any data to create ggmsa plot!!

We obtained the necessary data for ggMSA using the NCBI database. This allowed us to eliminate the need for any data tables or files. We used an R package to fetch the data from the internet, and successfully integrated it into our algorithm. Upon reviewing the code, you will notice how everything can be achieved at a basic level with concise and straightforward code. We hope this can be helpful to you.
